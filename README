Regexp-Common-microsyntax

This module provides regular expressions for matching microblogging-style
text (tweets, dents, microposts, etc.). It is based on the ruby
B<twitter-text> Regex class, with extensions to support features that
Twitter doesn't support (like status.net !group tags, microsyntax.org
slashtags, etc.).
